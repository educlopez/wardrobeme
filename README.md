# Wardrobeme

Wardrobeme is a web application that helps you organize your wardrobe by uploading an image of your clothes and detecting individual items and colors in the image. It's built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, with authentication provided by NextAuth. The project uses components from ui.shadcn.com to create a beautiful and intuitive user interface.

## Future Improvements

---

Here are some features we plan to add to Wardrobeme in the future:

- Search for tags in the gallery: We want to make it easier for users to find specific items in their wardrobe by allowing them to search for tags associated with each item.

- Fix gallery fetch images: We've noticed that the gallery can sometimes take a long time to load images. We're working on improving the performance of this feature to make the app faster.

- Add more features: We plan to add more features to Wardrobeme to make it even more useful. Some ideas include outfit suggestions based on the clothes you have, an option to donate clothes you no longer need, and integration with popular shopping apps.

- Show colors in gallery: We want to add a feature that allows users to see all the items in their wardrobe grouped by color, making it easier to coordinate outfits.

- More improvements: We're always looking for ways to improve the app and make it more useful for our users. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let us know!

Thank you for using Wardrobeme!
